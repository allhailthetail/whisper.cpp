#+title: Whisper.cpp Tutorial

* Clone and Install Deps:

- You probably will want to run this manually in your terminal of choice...

#+begin_src bash :results silent
  # First, you'll need to clone this repo:
  git clone https://github.com/allhailthetail/whisper.cpp.git .

  # Install necessary dependencies,
  #   May vary by your OS...
  sudo pacman -S base-devel cmake ffmpeg
#+end_src

* Build whisper.cpp:

- Runs make wiht however many processors you have

#+begin_src bash :results silent
make -j$(nproc)
#+end_src

* Download a ML model to use:

- Download the most lightweight model for testing

#+begin_src bash :results output
wget https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/resolve/main/ggml-base.en.bin \
    -O models/ggml-base.en.bin
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
* Extract Audio from Video:

- Apparently, this port only works with a very specific type of audio file...

#+begin_src bash :results silent
vid="$HOME/Videos/test.mp4"

ffmpeg -i "$vid" \
    -vn \
    -acodec pcm_s16le \
    -ar 16000 \
    -ac 1 \
    -y /tmp/extracted_audio.wav
#+end_src

* Run Program:

- Evaluates the extracted .wav file and run it against the pre-trained model

#+begin_src bash :results file :file extracted_text.txt
# define number of cores you'd like to devote to this cause:
num_cores=4

./build/bin/whisper-cli -f \
    /tmp/extracted_audio.wav \
    -t $num_cores
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:extracted_text.txt]]
